# 2D Physics Simulator

2D physics using a custom render engine written in C++ and OpenGL. Physics handled using the Separating axis theorem which allows for relatively fast speeds and rotation and angular physics are handled properly. Renderer uses batched rendering and a data centric model for the data that allows for tons of entities on the screen at once.
